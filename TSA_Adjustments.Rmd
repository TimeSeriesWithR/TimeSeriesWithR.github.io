### Key Sections in Seasonal Adjustment and Distributed Lags Analysis

#### Seasonal Adjustment Components
1. **Original Series**: Baseline data (e.g., monthly figures).
2. **Adjustments**: Various steps include:
   - **Prior Adjustments**: Monthly and trading-day adjustments.
   - **Trend-Cycle Components**: Smoothed series capturing overall trends.
   - **Seasonal Factors**: Patterns recurring annually.
   - **Irregular Components**: Unpredictable random variations.

#### Trading-Day Variation
- Different months have variable numbers of weekdays, influencing fluctuations in some series (e.g., revenue depends on the number of weekends).  
- **Adjustment Steps**:
  - Regression to estimate the impact of trading days.
  - Application of derived weights or factors.
  - Finalized adjustments for robust seasonal patterns.

#### Distributed Lags Analysis
- **Purpose**: Evaluate lagged effects of independent variables on time series.
- **Models**:
  1. General distributed lag model.
  2. Almon distributed lag: Reduces multicollinearity and simplifies parameter estimation.
