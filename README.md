### Time Series Analysis

This section outlines key techniques for analyzing and forecasting time series data. The topics include methods for identifying patterns (e.g., smoothing and curve fitting techniques, autocorrelations) and models such as autoregressive and moving average approaches for prediction. Simple yet effective techniques based on linear regression are also discussed.

### General Introduction

Time series data consists of successive measurements taken at equally spaced intervals. Unlike random sampling, time series analysis assumes that consecutive values are interdependent, reflecting potential trends or periodicities.

For more detailed methods and discussions, refer to works by Anderson (1976), Box and Jenkins (1976), Kendall (1984), Montgomery et al. (1990), Shumway (1988), and others.

### Two Main Goals

The primary objectives of time series analysis are:
1. **Understanding the Phenomenon**: Identify patterns and describe the observed sequence.
2. **Forecasting**: Extrapolate established patterns to predict future values.

These goals rely on identifying systematic patterns, interpreting them within a theoretical framework, and integrating findings into broader contexts, such as economic trends or seasonal pricing.
