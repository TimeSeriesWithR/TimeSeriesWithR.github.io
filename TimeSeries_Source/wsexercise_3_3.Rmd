#### Worksheet Exercise 3.3


Try a multiplicative model for all of the above. ``decompose()``
allows the selection of this via the ```type}' parameter. Is the
multiplicative model better? In either case, explain why this might be.



```{r}

AP.ts.mult.decomp <- decompose(AP.ts, type = 'multiplicative');

plot(AP.ts.mult.decomp);
```
