#### Worksheet Exercise 1.1

Load the air passengers data into your workspace and investigate the
structure of the \texttt{ts} object using ``str()``. How is a
\texttt{ts} object different from a standard vector in R? Plot it
using the default ``plot()`` method.



```{r}

class(AP.ts);
str(AP.ts);
```

```{r}
start(AP.ts); end(AP.ts); frequency(AP.ts);
```

```{r}
plot(AP.ts, ylab = "Air Passengers (\'000s)");
```

```{r}
### Using ggplot2 looks better, but you have to work hard for the
### labels on the x-axis so I am leaving this out for now.

qplot(1:length(AP.ts), as.vector(AP.ts), geom = 'line', ylab = 'Air Passengers (\'000s)');
```
