#### Worksheet Exercise 3.1

Using the ``decompose()`` function in R, look at the trend and
the seasonal variation for the airline passenger data. The output of
this function can be plotted directly, and visually check the
output. Does the output match your intuition about what you observed?

```{r}
AP.ts.decomp <- decompose(AP.ts);

str(AP.ts.decomp);
```

```{r}

plot(AP.ts.decomp);
```
