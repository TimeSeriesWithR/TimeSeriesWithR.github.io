### Multivariate Time Series


In many cases, we will also be dealing with time series that have
multiple values at all, many or some of the points in time.

Often, these values will be related in some ways, and we will want to analyse those relationships also. In fact, one of the most efficient
methods of prediction is to find ***leading indicators*** for the value or values you wish to predict --- you can often use the current
values of the leading indicators to make inference on future values of
the related quantities.

The fact that this is one of the best methods in time series analysis says a lot about the difficulty of prediction (Yogi Berra, a US
baseball player noted for his pithy statements, once said ``Prediction is difficult, especially about the future'').

#### Worked Exercise 2.1
Load in the multivariate data from the file ``cbe.dat``. Investigate the object type and some sample data to
get an idea of how it is structured. The R functions ``head()``
and ``tail()`` will be of use for this.

#### Worked Exercise 2.2
Create time series objects for this data using ``ts()``, and plot them beside each other. ``cbind()`` is useful for creating all
the plots together.

#### Worked Exercise 2.3
Merge the electricity usage data with the US airline passenger data using ``ts.intersect`` and investigate any possible similarities
between the two time series.

#### Worked Exercise 2.4
Use the ``cor()`` function, investigate the correlation between the two time series. How plausible is a causal effect in this case?
