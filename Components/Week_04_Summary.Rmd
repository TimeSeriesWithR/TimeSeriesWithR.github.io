### **Lesson Plan: Week 4 - Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation**  
**Course Focus:** Dive into autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF and PACF) to analyze the dependency structures in time series data.

### **Class 1: Understanding Autocorrelation**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Define autocorrelation and its role in time series analysis.  
- Understand how lagged values impact current observations.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Autocorrelation?**  
   - Relationship between a time series and its lagged versions.  
   - Mathematical definition:  
     $$\rho_k = \frac{\text{Cov}(Y_t, Y_{t-k})}{\text{Var}(Y_t)}$$  
   - Applications in identifying patterns and dependencies.  
2. **Significance of Lag**  
   - Lag structure and its implications for model selection.  
   - Visualizing autocorrelation to detect trends or cycles.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Compute autocorrelation using the `acf()` function.  
   - Visualize autocorrelation for datasets like `AirPassengers` and `nottem`.  

**Activities:**  
- Students compute and plot autocorrelation for given datasets, observing the relationship at different lags.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand autocorrelation and its significance in time series data.

### **Class 2: Partial Autocorrelation**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn the concept of partial autocorrelation and its distinction from full autocorrelation.  
- Understand PACF as a tool to isolate direct relationships between observations.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Partial Autocorrelation?**  
   - Measure of correlation between $Y_t$ and $Y_{t-k}$, removing effects of intermediate lags.  
   - Mathematical representation: Conditional correlation.  
2. **Interpreting PACF**  
   - PACF truncation for AR models.  
   - Visual patterns in PACF plots for model identification.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Compute PACF using the `pacf()` function.  
   - Compare PACF and ACF plots to isolate direct versus indirect dependencies.  

**Activities:**  
- Students interpret PACF plots for simulated AR processes and observe truncation patterns.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn how PACF complements ACF in time series analysis.

### **Class 3: Using ACF and PACF to Identify Models**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Apply ACF and PACF plots to identify AR and MA components in time series models.  
- Learn the role of these functions in model selection.  

**Content:**  
1. **ACF and PACF Patterns for Model Selection**  
   - AR Models: PACF truncates, ACF tails off.  
   - MA Models: ACF truncates, PACF tails off.  
   - ARIMA Models: Pre-differencing yields non-stationary patterns.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Generate ACF and PACF plots for simulated ARIMA models.  
   - Discuss model orders (p, d, q) based on plot interpretation.  

**Activities:**  
- Students use ACF and PACF plots to propose ARIMA models for datasets.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will gain skills to identify appropriate models using ACF and PACF.

### **Class 4: Practical Applications of ACF and PACF**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Use ACF and PACF in real-world time series analysis.  
- Discuss challenges and limitations in interpreting these plots.  

**Content:**  
1. **ACF and PACF in Practice**  
   - Examples: Analyzing stock market trends, environmental cycles, and sales patterns.  
   - Limitations: Noise, high seasonality, overfitting risks.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Apply ACF and PACF tools to real-world datasets.  
   - Combine results with exploratory visualizations to propose models.  

**Activities:**  
- Students analyze ACF and PACF plots for their datasets and present model recommendations based on findings.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will integrate ACF and PACF into practical time series workflows.
