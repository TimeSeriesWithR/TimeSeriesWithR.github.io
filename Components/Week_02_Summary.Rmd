### **Class 1: Introduction to Smoothing Methods**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand the concept of smoothing and its role in time series analysis.  
- Learn basic smoothing techniques to reveal underlying patterns.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Smoothing?**  
   - Definition: Reducing irregular fluctuations (noise) to highlight trends.  
   - Applications: Business forecasting, environmental data analysis, stock market trends.  
2. **Smoothing Techniques Overview**  
   - Moving average.  
   - Exponential smoothing.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Apply moving averages using the `TTR` package.  
   - Compare the effects of different smoothing windows on datasets (`AirPassengers`, `nottem`).  

**Activities:**  
- Experiment with smoothing windows (e.g., 3-month vs. 12-month moving average).  
- Discuss the impact of window size on the visibility of trends.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the purpose of smoothing and apply basic techniques in R.

### **Class 2: Exponential Smoothing**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn exponential smoothing to account for more recent observations in time series.  
- Compare exponential smoothing with moving averages.  

**Content:**  
1. **Exponential Smoothing Basics**  
   - Concept: Weight recent data points more heavily while retaining past observations.  
   - Formula: $S_t = \alpha Y_t + (1 - \alpha) S_{t-1}$  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Implement exponential smoothing using the `HoltWinters()` function.  
   - Compare exponential smoothing outputs to moving averages for `AirPassengers`.  

**Activities:**  
- Students adjust the smoothing parameter ($\alpha$) and observe its effect on trend visibility.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will apply exponential smoothing and understand its advantages for time-dependent data.

### **Class 3: Identifying Trends in Time Series Data**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn techniques for identifying and interpreting trends.  
- Understand how trends influence forecasting and model selection.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is a Trend?**  
   - Definition: Long-term movement or direction in data.  
   - Separating trend from seasonality and noise.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Use linear regression to model trends in time series data (`lm()` function).  
   - Explore trend projection for forecasting future values.  

**Activities:**  
- Students fit a regression model to identify trends in a time series dataset (e.g., monthly sales).  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn techniques to identify trends and their significance in time series analysis.

### **Class 4: Combining Smoothing and Trend Analysis**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Integrate smoothing techniques and trend analysis to prepare time series data for forecasting.  

**Content:**  
1. **Combining Smoothing and Regression**  
   - Apply smoothing methods to preprocess noisy data.  
   - Fit regression models to smoothed data for trend analysis.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Smooth time series data using moving averages or exponential smoothing.  
   - Fit regression models to detect trends and make predictions.  
   - Visualize the combined impact of smoothing and trend projection.  

**Activities:**  
- Students preprocess a real-world dataset (e.g., temperature data), identify trends, and make future projections.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will apply smoothing and regression techniques to prepare time series data for forecasting tasks.
