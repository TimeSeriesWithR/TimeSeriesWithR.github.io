### ARIMA

The ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) methodology, developed by Box and Jenkins (1976), provides a powerful framework for uncovering patterns in time series data and generating forecasts. Despite being widely used in various fields, ARIMA's complexity requires significant expertise to ensure satisfactory results (Bails & Peppers, 1982). Below is an overview of its key concepts and processes.

### General Introduction

Real-world time series often exhibit unclear patterns and considerable error in individual observations. ARIMA allows researchers to identify hidden patterns and forecast future observations without predefined models. Its flexibility and reliability have made it popular in fields ranging from economics to environmental studies (Hoff, 1983; Pankratz, 1983; Vandaele, 1983).

A detailed, non-mathematical introduction to ARIMA methods can be found in McDowall, McCleary, Meidinger, and Hay (1980).

### Two Common Processes in ARIMA

#### 1. **Autoregressive Process (AR)**  
Time series often exhibit serial dependence, meaning current observations are influenced by prior values. This process can be expressed as:

\[
x_t = c + \phi_1 x_{t-1} + \phi_2 x_{t-2} + ... + \epsilon_t
\]

Where:
- \( c \): A constant (intercept)  
- \( \phi_1, \phi_2, ... \): Autoregressive model parameters  
- \( \epsilon_t \): Random error (or "shock")  

Each observation combines a random error term and a linear combination of prior observations.

**Stationarity Requirement**:  
The autoregressive process remains stable only if parameters lie within specific bounds. For example, with one parameter, \(-1 < \phi < 1\). Violation of this condition results in non-stationary series, where values trend toward infinity.

---

#### 2. **Moving Average Process (MA)**  
In addition to autoregressive effects, each observation may also be influenced by past random shocks. This can be modeled as:

\[
x_t = \mu + \epsilon_t - \theta_1 \epsilon_{t-1} - \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} - ...
\]

Where:
- \( \mu \): A constant  
- \( \theta_1, \theta_2, ... \): Moving average model parameters  
- \( \epsilon_t \): Random error at time \( t \)

Each observation combines a random error term and a linear combination of past random shocks.

**Invertibility Requirement**:  
A moving average process can be rewritten into an autoregressive form of infinite order, provided invertibility conditions are met. These ensure stationarity and reliable model construction.

---

ARIMA integrates these processes into a unified framework, balancing the effects of both autoregression and moving averages. With a systematic approach to parameter identification, estimation, and model evaluation, ARIMA remains a cornerstone of time series analysis.
