### **Lesson Plan: Week 6 - Integrated Models in Time Series Analysis**  
**Course Focus:** Transforming non-stationary time series into stationary series through differencing and understanding integrated models.  

---

### **Class 1: Non-Stationarity and Differencing**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand what non-stationarity is and how it affects time series analysis.  
- Learn the concept and application of differencing to achieve stationarity.  

**Content:**  
1. **Introduction to Non-Stationarity**  
   - Characteristics of non-stationary time series (e.g., changing mean, increasing variance).  
   - Examples of non-stationary processes (e.g., random walk, seasonal trends).  
2. **Differencing**  
   - First-order differencing: $Y_t - Y_{t-1}$.  
   - Higher-order differencing (if needed): $\nabla^d Y_t$.  
   - When and why differencing is required for stationarity.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Load and plot non-stationary data (`plot.ts`).  
   - Apply differencing with `diff()` function and visualize results.  
   - Check stationarity using statistical tests (`adf.test` from the `tseries` package).  

**Activities:**  
- Students work with a dataset (e.g., monthly oil prices).  
- Plot raw data, apply differencing, and confirm stationarity.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the importance of stationarity and be able to apply differencing techniques to real datasets.

### **Class 2: Integrated Models and Random Walks**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recognize integrated models and random walk processes.  
- Understand how differencing leads to stationarity in random walks.  

**Content:**  
1. **Integrated Models (ARIMA)**  
   - Concept of integration in time series.  
   - Relating differencing to the "I" in ARIMA models.  
2. **Random Walk Process**  
   - Definition: $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + e_t$.  
   - Properties: Non-stationarity, increasing variance over time.  
   - Achieving stationarity through differencing.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Simulate a random walk with `arima.sim()`.  
   - Apply first-order differencing to random walk data.  
   - Visualize the transformation into a stationary process.

**Activities:**  
- Students simulate a random walk, visualize its properties, and transform it into a stationary time series.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand integrated models and practice working with random walks in R.

### **Class 3: ARIMA Model Overview and Identification**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explore the structure of ARIMA(p, d, q) models.  
- Understand the Box-Jenkins approach for model identification.  

**Content:**  
1. **Structure of ARIMA Models**  
   - Components: Auto-regressive (AR), Integration (I), and Moving Average (MA).  
   - Example processes: ARIMA(1, 1, 0), ARIMA(0, 1, 1), etc.  
2. **Model Identification**  
   - Use of ACF/PACF plots for AR and MA components.  
   - Diagnostic checks for differencing (stationarity, seasonality).  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Fit ARIMA models using `auto.arima()` (from the `forecast` package).  
   - Evaluate ACF/PACF plots (`acf()`, `pacf()`) to identify suitable models.  
   - Interpret model outputs and residual diagnostics.

**Activities:**  
- Students load a real-world dataset (e.g., financial or environmental time series).  
- Apply `auto.arima()` to identify and fit an initial ARIMA model.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand ARIMA model components and begin working with them in R.

### **Class 4: Model Diagnostics and Criticism**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Perform model diagnostics and evaluate ARIMA model performance.  
- Assess residuals and goodness-of-fit criteria.  

**Content:**  
1. **Model Diagnostics**  
   - Residual analysis: White noise assumptions, randomness, and independence.  
   - Residual plots: Visualizing residuals (`plot.ts` and `checkresiduals()` from `forecast`).  
2. **Criticism and Refinement**  
   - Evaluating model fit using AIC, BIC, and other statistical measures.  
   - Revisiting model assumptions and refining differencing or parameter selection.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Diagnostic residual analysis (`Ljung-Box Test` and `checkresiduals()`).  
   - Compare multiple models using AIC/BIC.  

**Activities:**  
- Students analyze residual plots of their fitted models and refine ARIMA parameters.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will critically evaluate ARIMA models and understand the iterative nature of time series modeling.
