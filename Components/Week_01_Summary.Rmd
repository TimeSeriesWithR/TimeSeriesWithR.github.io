### **Lesson Plan: Week 1 - Introduction to Time Series Analysis**  
**Course Focus:** Familiarize students with the fundamentals of time series data, its components, and how to visualize and interpret such data using R.

---

### **Class 1: Components of Time Series**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand what constitutes a time series.  
- Identify the key components: trend, seasonality, and random variation.

**Content:**  
1. **Introduction to Time Series**  
   - Definition and examples of time series data (e.g., stock prices, monthly temperature).  
   - Importance of time series analysis in forecasting and decision-making.  
2. **Components of Time Series**  
   - Trend: Long-term movement in data.  
   - Seasonality: Regular patterns over specific intervals.  
   - Noise/Random variation: Irregular fluctuations.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Loading time series datasets (`AirPassengers`, `nottem`).  
   - Visualizing data with `plot.ts()` and basic exploratory techniques.  

**Activities:**  
- Students work on identifying components in provided datasets using plots and discussions.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the key components of time series data and their relevance.

### **Class 2: Time Series Data Structure in R**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn how to load, structure, and handle time series data in R.  
- Explore properties of time series data.

**Content:**  
1. **Time Series Data in R**  
   - Introduction to `ts` objects in R.  
   - Recognizing the importance of start and frequency attributes (e.g., monthly vs. quarterly).  
2. **Exploring Datasets**  
   - Examples: `AirPassengers`, `co2`, custom datasets.  
   - Exploring summary statistics, time indices, and data types.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Creating a `ts` object from raw data.  
   - Subsetting and querying time series data.  

**Activities:**  
- Students convert tabular data into time series objects and explore its properties.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will be comfortable creating and handling time series objects in R.

### **Class 3: Visualizing Time Series Data**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Develop skills for effective visualization of time series data.  
- Interpret visual patterns to understand trends and seasonality.

**Content:**  
1. **Visualization Techniques**  
   - Basic line plots (`plot.ts`).  
   - Adding elements to plots (titles, axes labels).  
   - Highlighting trends and patterns through smoothing.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Create time series visualizations using `plot.ts`.  
   - Apply basic transformations for trend visualization (e.g., rolling averages).  
   - Experiment with `ggplot2` for advanced visuals.  

**Activities:**  
- Students produce multiple visualizations for a chosen dataset and present their observations.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand how to interpret and visually analyze time series data.

### **Class 4: Practical Introduction to Seasonal Patterns**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Explore seasonal components in time series data.  
- Analyze patterns and their implications for modeling and forecasting.

**Content:**  
1. **What Are Seasonal Patterns?**  
   - Identifying regular intervals (e.g., monthly sales, daily temperature).  
   - Understanding additive and multiplicative seasonality.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Seasonal decomposition using `decompose()` and `stl()`.  
   - Isolating seasonal patterns in data (`AirPassengers`).  
   - Analyzing deseasonalized data for trends.  

**Activities:**  
- Students compare seasonal decomposition outputs for different datasets and discuss observations.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will gain practical exposure to identifying and analyzing seasonal patterns.

### **Summary for Week 1**  
By the end of Week 1, students will:
- Identify the components of time series data.  
- Load, structure, and visualize time series datasets using R.  
- Analyze seasonal patterns for implications in forecasting.
