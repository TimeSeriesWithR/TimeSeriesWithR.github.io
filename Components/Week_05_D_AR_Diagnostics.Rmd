# Class 4: Diagnostics and Model Validation for AR Models in R

# Learning Objectives:
# - Perform diagnostics on AR models to ensure adequacy.
# - Use residual analysis for validation.

# Content:

# 1. Diagnostics for AR Models

#   - Residual analysis: Checking for white noise behavior.
#     The residuals of a well-fitted AR model should resemble white noise.
#     White noise means that the residuals are:
#       - Random (no discernible pattern).
#       - Have a constant mean (close to zero).
#       - Have constant variance.
#       - Are uncorrelated.

#   - Use of ACF and PACF on residuals for validation.
#     ACF (Autocorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial Autocorrelation Function)
#     of the residuals should show no significant autocorrelations if the model
#     is correctly specified.

# 2. Model Validation and Refinement

#   - Common pitfalls: Overfitting and underfitting.
#     - Overfitting: The model fits the training data too closely, capturing noise
#       and leading to poor performance on new data.
#     - Underfitting: The model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying
#       patterns in the data.

#   - Iterative adjustment of parameters for improved model fit.
#     Based on the diagnostic results, adjust the AR model's order (p) to improve
#     the fit. This might involve increasing or decreasing 'p' based on the
#     ACF and PACF of the residuals.

# 3. Hands-On with R:

#   - Perform residual diagnostics with `checkresiduals()` from the `forecast` package.
#   - Test residual independence using the Ljung-Box test (`Box.test()`).
#   - Refine AR models based on diagnostic outputs.

# Activities:
# - Students validate their previously fitted AR models, identify residual issues,
#   and refine their models.

# Outcomes:
# Students will master diagnostic techniques and ensure the reliability of AR
# models for analysis.

# Example: Fitting an AR model and performing diagnostics

# 1. Load necessary libraries.
library(forecast)
library(tseries)

# 2. Generate or load time series data.
set.seed(123)
n <- 100
ar_data <- arima.sim(model = list(ar = c(0.7, -0.2)), n = n)

# 3. Fit an AR model (e.g., AR(2)).
ar_model <- arima(ar_data, order = c(2, 0, 0))

# 4. Perform residual diagnostics using checkresiduals().
checkresiduals(ar_model)

#   - This function provides a plot of the residuals, their ACF, and a histogram.
#   - Observe the residual plot for any patterns.
#   - Check the ACF plot for significant spikes outside the blue confidence bands.
#   - The histogram should resemble a normal distribution.

# 5. Test residual independence using the Ljung-Box test.
ljung_box_test <- Box.test(ar_model$residuals, lag = 10, type = "Ljung-Box")
print(ljung_box_test)

#   - The null hypothesis (H0) of the Ljung-Box test is that the residuals are
#     independent (white noise).
#   - If the p-value is greater than the significance level (e.g., 0.05),
#     we fail to reject H0, indicating that the residuals are likely independent.
#   - If the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject H0,
#     suggesting that the residuals are not independent and the model may
#     need refinement.

# 6. Refine the AR model based on diagnostic outputs.

#   - If the residuals show significant autocorrelations in the ACF, try
#     adjusting the AR order (p).
#   - If the Ljung-Box test indicates non-independence, consider changing 'p'
#     or exploring other model types (e.g., ARIMA).

# Example of Refinement(In this example, the model is already good, but lets show how to change the order)

ar_model_refined <- arima(ar_data, order = c(3, 0, 0)) #example of changing the order.
checkresiduals(ar_model_refined)
ljung_box_test_refined <- Box.test(ar_model_refined$residuals, lag = 10, type = "Ljung-Box")
print(ljung_box_test_refined)

# Key points:
# - Always visualize the residuals and their ACF/PACF.
# - The Ljung-Box test provides a formal statistical test for independence.
# - Model refinement is an iterative process.
# - Avoid overfitting by not adding unnecessary parameters.
# - Ensure the residuals are as close to white noise as possible.
# - If the model is not adequate, explore other model types like ARIMA.
