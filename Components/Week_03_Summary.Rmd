### **Lesson Plan: Week 3 - Seasonality and Deseasonalizing Time Series**  
**Course Focus:** Analyze the seasonal patterns in time series data and learn techniques to remove seasonality for clearer trend and residual analysis.

---

### **Class 1: Understanding Seasonality in Time Series**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand what seasonality means in time series data.  
- Learn to distinguish seasonal patterns from trends and random noise.  

**Content:**  
1. **Defining Seasonality**  
   - Regular, repeating patterns in data (e.g., yearly, monthly, weekly).  
   - Examples: Retail sales, climate data, electricity usage.  
2. **Additive vs. Multiplicative Seasonality**  
   - Additive model: Seasonal effect remains constant.  
   - Multiplicative model: Seasonal effect grows or shrinks proportionally to the trend.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Visualize seasonal patterns using `plot.ts()` for datasets like `AirPassengers` and `nottem`.  
   - Discuss how to identify repeating cycles visually.  

**Activities:**  
- Students explore datasets with clear seasonal patterns and compare additive and multiplicative seasonal effects.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the concept of seasonality and its significance in analyzing time series data.

### **Class 2: Seasonal Decomposition**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn techniques for decomposing time series into trend, seasonality, and residuals.  
- Analyze decomposed data to isolate and understand seasonal effects.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Seasonal Decomposition?**  
   - Decomposing time series into components: Trend, seasonal, and remainder.  
   - Methods: Classical decomposition and STL (Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess).  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Apply decomposition techniques using `decompose()` (classical) and `stl()` (STL decomposition).  
   - Visualize decomposition outputs and interpret components.  

**Activities:**  
- Students apply seasonal decomposition techniques to real-world datasets and discuss how trend and residual components change after decomposition.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn to decompose time series data into its constituent parts and analyze the seasonal component.

### **Class 3: Deseasonalizing Time Series Data**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Remove seasonality from time series data to analyze trends and residuals.  
- Use deseasonalized data for modeling and forecasting.  

**Content:**  
1. **Why Deseasonalize Data?**  
   - Isolate trends and residuals for clearer analysis.  
   - Enhance accuracy of models and forecasts by removing seasonal noise.  
2. **Methods for Deseasonalizing**  
   - Subtraction for additive models: $$Deseasonalized = Observed - Seasonal Component$$  
   - Division for multiplicative models: $$Deseasonalized = Observed / Seasonal Component$$  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Use decomposition outputs to deseasonalize time series data.  
   - Visualize deseasonalized time series and compare with original data.  

**Activities:**  
- Students deseasonalize datasets using additive and multiplicative models and observe how seasonality removal impacts forecasting accuracy.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn practical methods to remove seasonality and improve time series analysis.

### **Class 4: Practical Applications of Deseasonalized Data**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Integrate deseasonalized data into modeling and forecasting workflows.  
- Understand the importance of deseasonalization for data-driven decisions.  

**Content:**  
1. **Real-World Applications of Deseasonalized Data**  
   - Examples:  
     - Forecasting business sales.  
     - Analyzing climate trends without seasonal fluctuations.  
   - Comparing results from seasonal and deseasonalized datasets.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Use deseasonalized data to fit ARIMA and Holt-Winters models.  
   - Compare forecast accuracy before and after deseasonalization.  

**Activities:**  
- Students analyze how deseasonalizing impacts model performance and refine forecasts based on deseasonalized data.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the importance of deseasonalization in predictive modeling and decision-making.

### **Summary for Week 3**  
By the end of Week 3, students will:  
- Identify seasonal patterns in time series data.  
- Use decomposition techniques to separate trend, seasonal, and residual components.  
- Remove seasonality from data to improve modeling and forecasting accuracy.
