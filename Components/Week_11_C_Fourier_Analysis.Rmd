### Single Spectrum (Fourier) Analysis

Spectrum analysis explores cyclical patterns in data by breaking down complex time series into sinusoidal (sine and cosine) functions of varying wavelengths. The term "spectrum" is apt, as the technique resembles passing white sunlight through a prism to separate its different wavelengths. Similarly, spectrum analysis identifies and highlights cyclical components within a time series, transforming what appears as random noise into meaningful patterns.

A classic example of spectrum analysis is the cyclical nature of sunspot activity, which follows an 11-year cycle (see Bloomfield, 1976, or Shumway, 1988). This method has also been applied to various phenomena such as weather patterns, commodity price fluctuations, and economic trends. Unlike ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing, which often involve predefined seasonal components, spectrum analysis aims to uncover the lengths of these seasonal fluctuations directly.

### Cross-Spectrum Analysis

Cross-spectrum analysis extends single spectrum analysis by examining two series simultaneously, identifying correlations across different frequencies. For example, sunspot activity might correlate with weather changes on Earth, with both exhibiting periodic behavior at an 11-year cycle. Similarly, other research areas—such as economic indicators or physiological measures—often benefit from identifying such synchronized cyclical relationships.

### Key Concepts in Spectrum Analysis

#### **Frequency and Period**
- *Frequency* (\( \nu \)): The number of cycles a sine or cosine wave completes per unit time.
- *Period* (\( T \)): The time required for one complete cycle, calculated as \( T = 1/\nu \).

#### **The General Structural Model**
A time series can be modeled as a sum of sine and cosine functions:

\[
x_t = a_0 + \sum_{k=1}^q [a_k \cdot \cos(k \cdot t) + b_k \cdot \sin(k \cdot t)]
\]

Here, \( a_k \) and \( b_k \) are coefficients indicating the contribution of each sinusoidal function. This framework helps identify frequencies with significant periodicity.

#### **Complex Numbers**
Spectrum analysis often uses complex numbers to simplify calculations, with Fourier transforms decomposing data into real and imaginary components for efficient computation.

### Example: Correlated Periodicities

Consider two time series with 16 observations. While their relationship may not be immediately evident, cross-spectrum analysis reveals two strong correlated periodicities in the data. The following spectral summary highlights these relationships:

| Frequency | Period   | X Density | Y Density | Cross Density | Cross Quad | Cross Amplitude |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-----------|---------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0.0625    | 16.00000 | 8.094709  | 7.798284  | 2.35583       | -7.58781   | 7.945114        |
| 0.1250    |  8.00000 | 0.058771  | 0.100936  | -0.04755      |  0.06059   | 0.077020        |

This analysis uncovers cyclical components hidden in the data, revealing their significance and correlation across frequencies.

Results for Each Variable

The complete summary contains all spectrum statistics computed for each variable, as described in the Single Spectrum (Fourier) Analysis overview section. Looking at the results shown above, it is clear that both variables show strong periodicities at the frequencies .0625 and .1875.

Cross-Periodogram, Cross-Density, Quadrature-Density, Cross-Amplitude

Analogous to the results for the single variables, the complete summary will also display periodogram values for the cross periodogram. However, the cross-spectrum consists of complex numbers that can be divided into a real and an imaginary part. These can be smoothed to obtain the cross-density and quadrature density (quad density for short) estimates, respectively. (The reasons for smoothing, and the different common weight functions for smoothing are discussed in the Single Spectrum (Fourier) Analysis.) The square root of the sum of the squared cross-density and quad-density values is called the cross- amplitude. The cross-amplitude can be interpreted as a measure of covariance between the respective frequency components in the two series. Thus we can conclude from the results shown in the table above that the .0625 and .1875 frequency components in the two series covary.

Squared Coherency, Gain, and Phase Shift

There are additional statistics that can be displayed in the complete summary.

Squared coherency. You can standardize the cross-amplitude values by squaring them and dividing by the product of the spectrum density estimates for each series. The result is called the squared coherency, which can be interpreted similar to the squared correlation coefficient (see Correlations - Overview), that is, the coherency value is the squared correlation between the cyclical components in the two series at the respective frequency. However, the coherency values should not be interpreted by themselves; for example, when the spectral density estimates in both series are very small, large coherency values may result (the divisor in the computation of the coherency values will be very small), even though there are no strong cyclical components in either series at the respective frequencies.

Gain. The gain value is computed by dividing the cross-amplitude value by the spectrum density estimates for one of the two series in the analysis. Consequently, two gain values are computed, which can be interpreted as the standard least squares regression coefficients for the respective frequencies.

Phase shift. Finally, the phase shift estimates are computed as tan**-1 of the ratio of the quad density estimates over the cross-density estimate. The phase shift estimates (usually denoted by the Greek letter ) are measures of the extent to which each frequency component of one series leads the other.

How the Example Data were Created

Now, let's return to the example data set presented above. The large spectral density estimates for both series, and the cross-amplitude values at frequencies  = 0.0625 and  = .1875 suggest two strong synchronized periodicities in both series at those frequencies. In fact, the two series were created as:

v1 = cos(2**.0625*(v0-1)) + .75*sin(2**.2*(v0-1))

v2 = cos(2**.0625*(v0+2)) + .75*sin(2**.2*(v0+2))

(where v0 is the case number). Indeed, the analysis presented in this overview reproduced the periodicity "inserted" into the data very well.
