### Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)

FFT revolutionized spectrum analysis by drastically reducing computation time. This technique breaks down complex time series into underlying cyclical components far more efficiently than earlier methods.

#### General Introduction
In the past, spectrum decomposition required solving sine and cosine parameters using explicit formulae, which involved at least \( N^2 \) complex multiplications. For example, analyzing 8,000 observations would demand at least 64 million multiplications—an impractical task, even with modern computers.

The game changer came with the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)**, popularized in 1965 by J.W. Cooley and J.W. Tukey. This algorithm reduced computational time to \( N \cdot \log_2(N) \), making spectral analysis significantly faster. Refinements to FFT have been detailed by Monro (1975) and Monro & Branch (1976).

One limitation of the standard FFT algorithm is that it requires input series lengths to be powers of 2 (e.g., 16, 64, 128). Padding the series resolves this but may complicate result interpretation when time units are meaningful.

#### Computation of FFT in Time Series
The FFT algorithm handles large series efficiently, even exceeding 100,000 cases, but some considerations apply:
1. **Series Length as a Power of 2**:  
   For optimal performance, series lengths should equal powers of 2. If not, padding the series is necessary for FFT compatibility.  
   
2. **Small to Moderate Series**:  
   For shorter series (a few thousand cases), no special adjustments are required. The analysis remains swift using explicit computational formulas.  

3. **Large Series**:  
   For extensive series (over 100,000 cases), padding to a power of 2 is highly recommended. Additionally, tapering the series during exploratory data analysis enhances interpretation.

By combining the speed of FFT with careful preprocessing techniques, even vast time series can be analyzed quickly and effectively.
