### **Class 1: Introduction to Autoregressive Models**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand the structure and purpose of AR models.  
- Identify conditions for stationarity in AR processes.  

**Content:**  
1. **Defining AR Models**  
   - AR models express current values as a function of past values and white noise.  
   - AR(1): $$Y_t = \phi Y_{t-1} + e_t$$  
   - AR(2): $$Y_t = \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + e_t$$  
   - General AR(p).  
2. **Stationarity Conditions**  
   - Stationarity is achieved when $|\phi| < 1$.  
   - Discussion of implications when stationarity is violated.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Simulate AR(1) and AR(2) processes using `arima.sim()`.  
   - Visualize generated data to identify stationary and non-stationary behavior.  

**Activities:**  
- Students experiment with different $\phi$ values in simulations and evaluate the impact on stationarity.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will gain foundational knowledge of AR models and their basic properties.

### **Class 2: Estimation of Parameters in AR Models**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn techniques for parameter estimation in AR models.  
- Understand the role of the Yule-Walker equations.  

**Content:**  
1. **Parameter Estimation Techniques**  
   - Yule-Walker equations for AR processes:  
     $$\rho_k = \phi_1 \rho_{k-1} + \phi_2 \rho_{k-2} + \dots + \phi_p \rho_{k-p}$$  
   - Relating sample autocorrelation ($r_k$) to theoretical autocorrelation ($\rho_k$).  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Estimate AR parameters using `ar()` and `arima()` functions.  
   - Compare estimated coefficients with theoretical values.  

**Activities:**  
- Students fit AR(1) and AR(2) models to sample data and compute parameter estimates.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will gain practical skills in estimating AR parameters and understanding their significance.

### **Class 3: Applications of AR Models**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Apply AR models to real-world datasets for analysis.  
- Use AR models for forecasting future values.  

**Content:**  
1. **Applications in Real-World Scenarios**  
   - Examples: Financial time series (stock prices), environmental data (temperature, rainfall).  
   - Discussing the predictive power of AR models.  
2. **Forecasting with AR Models**  
   - Generate forecasts based on fitted models.  
   - Discuss limitations and assumptions in predictions.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Fit AR models to real datasets (e.g., `nottem`, custom datasets).  
   - Use `forecast()` to generate and visualize predictions.  

**Activities:**  
- Students apply AR models to a real-world dataset, forecast future values, and interpret results.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the utility of AR models for analyzing and forecasting time series data.

### **Class 4: Diagnostics and Model Validation**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Perform diagnostics on AR models to ensure adequacy.  
- Use residual analysis for validation.  

**Content:**  
1. **Diagnostics for AR Models**  
   - Residual analysis: Checking for white noise behavior.  
   - Use of ACF and PACF on residuals for validation.  
2. **Model Validation and Refinement**  
   - Common pitfalls: Overfitting and underfitting.  
   - Iterative adjustment of parameters for improved model fit.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Perform residual diagnostics with `checkresiduals()` from the `forecast` package.  
   - Test residual independence using the Ljung-Box test (`Box.test()`).  
   - Refine AR models based on diagnostic outputs.  

**Activities:**  
- Students validate their previously fitted AR models, identify residual issues, and refine their models.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will master diagnostic techniques and ensure the reliability of AR models for analysis.
