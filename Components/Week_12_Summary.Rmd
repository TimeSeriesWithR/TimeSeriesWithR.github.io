### **Class 1: Review of Key Concepts**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Recap essential concepts and methods covered during the course.  
- Address any remaining questions or difficulties students might have.  

**Content:**  
1. **Concept Recap**

   - Diagnostic tools: ACF, PACF, residual analysis.  
   - ARIMA and other forecasting methods (Holt-Winters, spectral analysis).  
2. **Open Forum for Questions**  
   - Students can ask questions about past topics or seek clarification on specific methods.  
3. **Hands-On Review in R:**  
   - Apply diagnostic tools (`acf`, `pacf`, `checkresiduals`) to a new dataset.  
   - Practice model selection using `auto.arima()` and other functions.  

**Activities:**  
- Group discussions to review challenges from prior lessons.  
- In-class exercises to summarize time series characteristics from a dataset.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will consolidate their understanding of key time series concepts and tools.

**Learning Objectives:**  
- Begin working on the final project by selecting a dataset and exploring its characteristics.  
- Define objectives for the analysis and identify potential challenges.  

**Content:**  
1. **Project Scope and Guidelines**  
   - Instructions for the final project:  
     - Choose a real-world dataset.  
     - Identify trends, seasonality, and relationships.  
     - Fit appropriate models and forecast future values.  
     - Evaluate model performance.  
   - Requirements for the project report and presentation.  
2. **Dataset Selection and Exploration**  
   - Sources: Online repositories, real-world problems (e.g., stock prices, environmental data, sales data).  
   - Tools: Load, visualize, and summarize datasets in R.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Initial data exploration: Import data, check structure, plot time series.  
   - Discuss potential models based on characteristics.  

**Activities:**  
- Students select a dataset and begin exploratory data analysis.  
- Group discussion of dataset challenges and initial modeling ideas.  

**Outcomes:**

### **Class 3: Model Fitting and Forecasting for Final Projects**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Fit appropriate time series models for chosen datasets.  
- Use forecasting methods to generate predictions.  

**Content:**  
1. **Model Fitting**  
   - Apply ARIMA, Holt-Winters, or other methods based on the dataset's characteristics.  
   - Adjust model parameters for improved performance (e.g., seasonal adjustments).  
2. **Forecasting**  
   - Generate point forecasts and prediction intervals.  
   - Evaluate forecast accuracy using metrics (MAPE, RMSE).  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Fit models using `arima()`, `HoltWinters()`, and `forecast()`.  
   - Visualize forecasts and assess residuals for chosen models.  

**Activities:**  
- Students work independently on fitting models and generating forecasts for their projects.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will apply advanced modeling and forecasting techniques to their datasets.

   - Each student presents:  
     - Dataset description.  
     - Key findings from analysis (trend, seasonality, patterns).  
     - Model selection, diagnostics, and forecasts.  
     - Limitations and areas for further exploration.  
2. **Peer and Instructor Feedback**  
   - Constructive feedback on methodology, interpretation, and presentation clarity.  
3. **Wrap-Up Discussion**  
   - Reflect on key learning outcomes of the course.  
   - Discuss future applications of time series analysis in academic or professional settings.  

**Activities:**
