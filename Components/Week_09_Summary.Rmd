### **Class 1: Forecast Accuracy Metrics**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand the importance of evaluating forecasting accuracy.  
- Learn different metrics to measure forecast performance.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Forecast Accuracy?**  
   - Importance of measuring how well a model predicts future values.  
   - Challenges in assessing predictive accuracy over different time horizons.  
2. **Key Accuracy Metrics**  
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE).  
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).  
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).  
   - Mean Forecast Error (bias).  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Compute forecast accuracy metrics using the `accuracy()` function from the `forecast` package.  
   - Evaluate simple models (e.g., ARIMA, Holt-Winters) using provided datasets.  

**Activities:**  
- Students calculate MAE, MAPE, and RMSE for forecasts generated from example models.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand different forecast metrics and their implications for model evaluation.

### **Class 2: Visualizing Forecast Performance**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Use visual tools to assess forecast accuracy and residual behavior.  
- Interpret residual plots for forecasting diagnostics.  

**Content:**  
1. **Evaluating Forecasts Visually**  
   - Plot actual vs. predicted values.  
   - Residual diagnostics: Randomness and independence assumptions.  
   - Prediction intervals and their role in assessing forecast reliability.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Visualize residuals using `checkresiduals()` and `autoplot()` functions.  
   - Generate actual vs. forecast plots and overlay confidence intervals.  

**Activities:**  
- Students generate residual plots and interpret patterns for model adequacy.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn to use visualization techniques to validate forecast performance.

### **Class 3: Comparing Forecasting Models**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Compare different forecasting methods to determine the best-performing model.  
- Use multiple metrics and techniques to make informed comparisons.  

**Content:**  
1. **Model Comparison**  
   - Comparing models using accuracy metrics (e.g., AIC, BIC, RMSE).  
   - Assessing complexity and overfitting risks in forecasting models.  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Compare performance of ARIMA vs. Holt-Winters models.  
   - Use `accuracy()` to rank models based on error metrics.  

**Activities:**  
- Students apply both Holt-Winters and ARIMA models to a shared dataset and compare their performance.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will gain experience comparing and ranking forecasting models using both statistical and visual tools.

### **Class 4: Refining Forecast Models**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn how to improve forecasts by iterating on model specifications.  
- Address issues identified in model diagnostics.  

**Content:**  
1. **Refining Models**  
   - Iteratively tuning model parameters (e.g., ARIMA orders, Holt-Winters smoothing weights).  
   - Revisiting assumptions and data transformations (e.g., differencing, logarithmic transformations).  
2. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Refine models based on earlier evaluations.  
   - Experiment with parameter adjustments using `auto.arima()` and `HoltWinters()`.  
   - Evaluate improvements with updated metrics and plots.  

**Activities:**  
- Students refine their forecasting models based on diagnostic feedback and re-evaluate their performance.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn to iteratively refine and improve models for more accurate and reliable forecasts.
