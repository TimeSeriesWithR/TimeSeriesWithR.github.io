### **Class 1: Introduction to Bivariate Time Series**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand what bivariate time series are and why they matter.  
- Learn how relationships between time series are analyzed.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Are Bivariate Time Series?**  
   - Two time series observed simultaneously (e.g., stock prices and interest rates).  
   - Importance in understanding dynamic relationships between variables.  
2. **Applications of Bivariate Time Series Analysis**  
   - Examples:  
     - Economic indicators and financial markets.  
     - Weather variables (temperature and precipitation).  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Explore bivariate datasets, such as economic or environmental time series.  
   - Visualize both series over time to observe relationships.  

**Activities:**  
- Students load and plot bivariate time series data to observe trends and potential correlations.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will gain an understanding of bivariate time series and their applications.

### **Class 2: Cross-Correlation Function (CCF)**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Learn how to compute and interpret the cross-correlation function.  
- Understand lagged relationships between two time series.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Cross-Correlation?**  
   - Definition: Measures the strength of association between two time series at different lags.  
   - Positive and negative cross-correlation and their implications.  
2. **Using Cross-Correlation in R**  
   - Computing the cross-correlation function with `ccf()`.  
   - Interpreting cross-correlation plots: lead and lag relationships.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Compute the cross-correlation function for paired time series datasets.  
   - Identify significant lags and interpret their meaning.  

**Activities:**  
- Students analyze provided time series data (e.g., temperature and electricity demand) to compute and interpret CCF plots.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will learn to calculate and interpret the cross-correlation function to understand relationships between variables.

### **Class 3: Cross-Spectrum Analysis**  
**Learning Objectives:**  
- Understand frequency domain analysis for bivariate time series.  
- Explore the concept of cross-spectrum and its components.  

**Content:**  
1. **What Is Cross-Spectrum Analysis?**  
   - Cross-spectrum: Measures how two series interact in the frequency domain.  
   - Key components: Co-spectrum and quadrature spectrum.  
2. **Applications in Frequency Analysis**  
   - Identifying shared periodicities in two time series.  
   - Examples: Economic cycles or seasonal variations in environmental data.  
3. **Hands-On with R:**  
   - Compute and interpret cross-spectra using the `spectrum()` function and related tools.  

**Activities:**  
- Students analyze the frequency domain relationship of datasets, identifying common periodic patterns.  

**Outcomes:**  
Students will understand the role of cross-spectrum analysis and its application to bivariate time series.
