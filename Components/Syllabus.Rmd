### **Lesson Plan: 12-Week Course on "Time Series Analysis with R"**

---

#### **Course Overview**
**Rationale and Purpose:**  
This course explores the statistical underpinnings of time series analysis, emphasizing model identification, fitting, criticism, and forecasting in time and frequency domains using R.  

**Learning Outcomes (LO):**  
By the end of the course, students will:
1. Calculate theoretical autocorrelation, partial autocorrelation, spectrum, and spectral density for time series models.  
2. Use diagnostic tools and plots in R to identify appropriate models for seasonal ARIMA processes.  
3. Apply model-fitting and parameter estimation methods, leveraging maximum likelihood estimation, Yule-Walker equations, AIC, and BIC criteria.  
4. Compute forecasts and prediction errors for seasonal ARIMA models.  
5. Analyze cross-correlation and cross-spectrum in bivariate processes.  
6. Interpret statistical outputs from R for applied time series analysis.
